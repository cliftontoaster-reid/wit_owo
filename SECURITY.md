## Supported Versions

We will support the latest version of this package, and the latest version of the previous major version. We will not support any other versions.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of this package's 0.x version, we cannot guarantee the support of these versions, and we may not be able to provide a fix for any vulnerabilities found in these versions. 

Although we strive to provide the best support possible, and we will do our best to never have to drop support for any version, our resources are limited, but we hope to provide the best support possible for you.
